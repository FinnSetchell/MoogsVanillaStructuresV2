**Overview**
------------
Please comment any ideas you may have to improve this mod.

&nbsp;

**Forge version** might come in the future, idk. If anyone wants to convert it then just ask me :)
&nbsp;

This mod adds a bunch of vanilla style structures into the game. They all use vanilla blocks and entities for those who prefer the vanilla look. It also means it works nicely in modpacks because it doesn't fill your game up with a tonne of useless blocks.
